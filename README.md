Rust implementation of crafting interpreters language 'lox'

I followed the crafting interpreters book to implement jlox, lox java implementation.
To solidify my understanding of the theory, this is an implementation of lox using Rust.

Most of the implementation is very similar to the original java implementation, but
environments work a little different (behaviour is still the same though).
